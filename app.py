# Python is an interpreted language, which means the source code of a Python 
# program is converted into bytecode that is then executed by the Python virtual machine. 
# Python is different from major compiled languages, such as C and C + +, as Python code is not 
# required to be built and linked like code for these languages.


# The else Statement
# With the else statement we can run a block of code once when the condition no longer is true:

i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  i += 1
else:
  print("i is no longer less than 6")

#CEIL and FLOOR
# The math.ceil() method rounds a number upwards to its nearest integer, and the math.floor() method rounds a 
# number downwards to its nearest integer, and returns the result:

#   Python For Loops
# A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary,
#  a set, or a string).
# This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method 
# as found 
# in other object-orientated programming languages.
# With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.

#The range() function defaults to 0 as a starting value, however it is possible to specify the starting 
#value by adding a parameter: range(2, 6), which means values from 2 to 6 (but not including 6):

# The range() function defaults to increment the sequence by 1, however it is possible to specify 
# the increment value by adding a third parameter: range(2, 30, 3):
#The else keyword in a for loop specifies a block of code to be executed when the loop is finished:
# Note: The else block will NOT be executed if the loop is stopped by a break statement.
