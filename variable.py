#python needs to externally typecast the values it doesnt typecast internally
# int()#converts to integer
# str()# converts to string
# type()# gives the current data type of variable

# Python has no command for declaring a variable.
# A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
#Python is case sensitive

#Multi Words Variable Names
#Camel Case - myVariableName
#Pascal Case - MyVariableName
#snake Case - my_variable_name
